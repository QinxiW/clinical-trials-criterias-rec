NCT04116320,Focused Ultrasound Ablation and PD-1 Antibody Blockade in Advanced Solid Tumors,"Inclusion Criteria:

1. Age ≥18 years.
2. Advanced solid tumor with measurable disease.
3. Subject must have failed or have contraindication to standard therapies.
4. For Cohort 1, primary regimen (Regimen 1a): Patients with advanced solid malignancy for which PD1 or PDL1 antibody monotherapy administered on a 3-week schedule is FDA-approved for treatment, who have one or more tumor deposits that are accessible to focused ultrasound treatment, and who are eligible to receive (or to continue to receive) PD1 or PDL1 blockade therapy. Uveal melanoma patients are not eligible for Regimen 1a.

   Note: Participants eligible for this regimen may receive the primary protocol therapy (Regimen 1a) concurrent with PD1/PDL1 antibody therapy if:
   * Progressive Disease: subjects with progressive disease following PD1/PDL1 antibody therapy are eligible for this cohort if it is clinically appropriate for them to continue on systemic PD1/PDL1 antibody per the treating clinician even if they did not begin treatment on this trial. Examples may include a patient with a small new lesion but stable disease in other sites, or very slight tumor growth in multiple sites, in a patient without other approved therapy options. Participants who progress following PD1/PDL1 antibody therapy may undergo interval resection of enlarging lesions and still be included in this cohort as long as they have persistent unresectable disease that is accessible to FUSA treatment.
   * Response with persistent disease: subjects who have a clinical response (SD or PR) and have residual lesion(s) accessible to FUSA treatment. Participants with PR are only eligible if it is clinically appropriate for them to continue on PD1/PDL1 therapy per the judgement of the treating clinician.
   * Stable disease: The majority of clinical responses to PD1/PDL1 blockade occur within 12 weeks but may occur much later. Routine clinical practice commonly includes continuation of PD1 antibody therapy for 1-2 years for patients with stable disease on that therapy. Thus, patients with SD after 12 weeks of PD1/PDL1 therapy per RECIST criteria may be eligible for Regimen 1a if their disease has remained stable on therapy and if their treating provider recommends continuation of PD1/PDL1 therapy even if they were not treated on this trial.
5. For Cohort 1, secondary regimen (Regimen 2a): For those patients treated with primary regimen 1a, select participants may be enrolled in a secondary regimen. This would include participants in the following scenarios:

   * Stable disease.
   * Response in lesion treated in regimen 1, but persistent disease or progression in a separate lesion.
   * Initial partial response but still persistent disease at the treated lesion.
   * Initial response followed by progression at treated lesion or separate site, after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. If there is a response and then progression at the site treated in Regimen 1 and the residual tumor meets inclusion criteria, this lesion may be re-treated on the secondary regimen.
   * Participants with lesions unique from the lesion treated in regimen 1 may enroll in regimen 2 and have additional lesion(s) treated, as long as they meet all inclusion criteria requirements. Up to three lesions may be treated in the second regimen.

   Patients enrolling to Regimen 2a must have a target lesion amenable to intratumoral injection with polyICLC per the treating clinician's discretion. The lesion(s) to be FUSA treated in regimen 2 do not need to include the lesion targeted in regimen 1. The patient must remain eligible for PD1/PDL1 Ab therapy.
6. For Cohort 2, primary regimen (Regimen 1b): The following patient subsets would be eligible for the Cohort 2 primary regimen, as long as they have failed (progressed or not tolerated) or are not eligible for all effective available approved therapies known to confer clinical benefit:

   * Patients with advanced solid malignancy for which PD1 or PDL1 blockade is not FDA-approved.
   * Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma
   * Patients with advanced solid malignancies for which PD1 or PDL1 blockade is FDA approved but who are not eligible to receive that therapy because of prior failure, toxicity, baseline autoimmune disease, or frailty.
   * Patients who previously responded to PD1/PDL1 therapy but then progressed, if there are no other systemic therapies available to them.

   Patients who were previously undergoing PD-1 blockade therapy must not have received a dose within 4 weeks prior to FUSA treatment.
7. For Cohort 2, secondary regimen (Regimen 2b): For those patients treated with primary regimen 1a or 1b, select participants may be enrolled in a secondary regimen. This would include participants in the following scenarios:

   * Stable disease.
   * Response in lesion treated in regimen 1, but persistent disease or progression in a separate lesion.
   * Initial partial response but still persistent disease at the treated lesion.
   * Initial response followed by progression at the treated lesion after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. If there is a response and then progression at the site treated in Regimen 1 and the residual tumor meets inclusion criteria, this lesion may be re-treated on the secondary regimen. For participants who progress at a site unique from the treated lesion, they may enroll in Regimen 2 and have this new lesion treated, as long as they meet all inclusion criteria requirements.
   * Participants with lesions unique from the lesion treated in regimen 1 may enroll in regimen 2 and have additional lesion(s) treated, as long as they meet all inclusion criteria requirements. Up to three lesions may be treated in the second regimen.

   Patients enrolling to Regimen 2b must have a target lesion amenable to intratumoral injection with polyICLC per the treating clinician's discretion. The lesion to be FUSA treated in regimen 2 does not need to be the same lesion targeted in regimen 1. Crossover from primary regimen 1a is allowed if the patient is no longer eligible for continued PD1/PDL1 Ab therapy (e.g. due to autoimmune toxicity), and if there is no other effective systemic therapy option. The length between the FUSA treatments in regimen 1 and regimen 2 should be no less than 6 weeks. Patients who experienced an unanticipated device effect in the primary regimen are not eligible for the secondary regimen.
8. One or more dermal, subcutaneous or nodal metastases from an advanced solid tumor. The metastases need to be accessible for FUSA and for biopsy.

   For FUSA:

  o Note: Lesions previously injected with Talimogene laherparepvec or other local therapies may not be selected as target lesions unless they have demonstrated subsequent growth after injection
* If a suitable archival tissue sample is available, the patient must be willing to have this specimen submitted for research. If an archival sample is not available, the patient is still a candidate for the trial, and every reasonable effort will be made to obtain a biopsy if deemed safe
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

  * Adequate laboratory function at screening, defined as:
  * Hemoglobin ≥ 10 gm/dL (≥ 6.2 mmol/L)
  * Platelet count ≥ 100 × 10\^9 /L
  * Serum direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN; AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN. (Total bilirubin \< 3 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's disease)

* All women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)\* or sexually active men must practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Highly effective contraceptive measures in women include

  * Stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening,
  * Intrauterine device (IUD),
  * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS),
  * Bilateral tubal ligation,
  * Vasectomized partner,† and/or
  * Sexual abstinence.‡,§
* Male study participants with WOCBP partners are required to use condoms unless they are vasectomized† or practice sexual abstinence.‡,§
* \* WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.

  * Vasectomized partner or vasectomized study participant must have received medical assessment of the surgical success.

    * Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

      * Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.

Replication-incompetent viral, mRNA, subunit, conjugate, and toxoid vaccines are allowed.
* COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic consideration: The COVID-19 vaccination should not be delayed; however, caution should be exercised when combining vaccination with cancer therapy, particularly immunotherapy. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause transient lymphadenopathy and potentially impact assessment of disease burden during screening and/or on-study. To allow correct interpretation and reduce equivocal findings, investigators should discuss with the participant appropriate timing and selection of anatomic site of vaccination (alternative) with respect to imaging scans (MRI or CT). Screening scans should be acquired before the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or 4-6 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. Because cancer patients are considered vulnerable population, after COVID-19 vaccination there is also a potential for heightened immune related adverse events including CRS. Investigators should use judgement when evaluating and managing potentially overlapping adverse events and in establishing causality with the study treatment (Schönrich and Raftery 2019; Desai et al. 2021; Edmonds et al. 2021; Indini et al. 2021)
