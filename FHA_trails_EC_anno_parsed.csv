3. A diagnosis of hypogonadism, infertility or other reproductive dysfunction

   Some specific diagnoses (as defined in standard guidelines) will include:
   * Male or female hypogonadism

     * Obesity/metabolic syndrome related to hypogonadism.
     * Other reproductive dysfunction (e.g., secondary to endocrine dysfunction, thyroid disorders, Cushing syndrome, pharmacotherapy, etc.)

4. Ability of participant, legal guardian, or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:

1. A diagnosis of a serious medical disorder such as malignancy or heart disease will be grounds for exclusion at the discretion of the PI or AI.
2. Inability to follow up with the research study and/or perform study procedures, at the discretion of the PI or AI.
3. Pregnant participants, less than 18 years of age, for their safety, since there is not a trained doctor on the study to give proper medical care to pregnant individuals less than 18 years of age.

Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) because of an acute, reversible or transient medical reason may be rescreened upon reversal, improvement or stabilization of their clinical status.

The essential inclusion criteria include:

1. failure to go through a normal, age-appropriate, spontaneous puberty and low sex steroid levels in the setting of low/normal gonadotropins (due to substantial variability among patient presentations, this will be based on the clinical judgement of the Investigator), or
2. abnormally early development of puberty, or
3. normal puberty with subsequent development of low gonadotropin levels, or
4. individuals with features indicating an increased risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
5. Family members: both affected and unaffected family members are strongly encouraged to participate.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

Since hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare condition, this protocol remains open to enrollment so that we may study all subjects that are both qualified and interested in participating.
